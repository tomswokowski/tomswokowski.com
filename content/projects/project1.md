## Introduction

In this project, we built a blog using React and Next.js. The blog supports markdown posts. Here, we document the steps we followed to set up this project.

## Steps to Build the Blog

1. Set up a new Next.js application.
2. Add React and Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Set up dynamic routes in Next.js to handle individual blog posts.
4. Use `gray-matter` and `remark` to parse the markdown files.
5. Create a simple layout for the blog.
