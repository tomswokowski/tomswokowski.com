## Introduction

In this project, we built an e-commerce store using React. We integrated with a third-party API for product information.

## Steps to Build the Store

1. Set up a new Create React App application.
2. Add Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Use `fetch` to retrieve product information from the API.
4. Create a simple layout for the store including a product list and individual product pages.
5. Add functionality to add items to a shopping cart.

This is a screenshot of the final result:
